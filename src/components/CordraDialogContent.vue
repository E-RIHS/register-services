        This link will open the <em>E-RIHS Knowledge Base</em> in a separate browser tab. You might find it useful to keep the <em>Service Registration Tool</em> open 
        and return here if you want to consult the explanations. Also, if you noticed that you forgot to create a description in one 
        of the previous steps, you can leave the tab on the Knowledge Base open, while returning to a previous step.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
        Even though you have successfully logged in here, you might need to log in separately in the Knowledge Base. If this is the case,
        click on "Sign In" in the top right corner of the Knowledge Base and choose the tab "Login with ORCID iD". It is normal that you
        do not have to fill in your username/ORCID iD and password again (ORCID iD single sign-on).

        Don't forget to save your work in the Knowledge Base. In case you encounter an error which you cannot solve yourself (Cordra's error messages can be cryptic),
        you can temporarily copy your work to in text file, and ask for help. To create this text file, look for the "Edit as JSON" link under the "Save" button 
        at the top of the form. Copy the content of the large text box that appears, and paste it in a text file (e.g. in Notepad).
