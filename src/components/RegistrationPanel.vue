        Logging into this administration system, to directly add, modify and delete digital objects, is achieved using an ORCID iD.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
        However, users need to be pre-registered in the system before they can login; having an ORCID iD is not sufficient.
        <strong>Registration is done by contacting wim[dot]fremout[at]kikirpa[dot]be</strong>, specifying your ORCID iD, primary e-mail address and details of your primary affiliation/organisation.
        Organisation details should include a full name and an acronym.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
        A user account will be set up for you, along with details of you as a person and your related organisation. 
        You will be notified by email when this is done, and you will then be able to login using your ORCID iD.
